/*
 * A key reversal (higher high [lower low] than previous bar and close below [above] prior close) and range of bar
 * is greater than the average range of the last 20 days or weeks.  A J Spike is a reversal warning (not a signal).
 * During strong trends, there will be some terrible false warnings.  In other words, additional analysis (pattern, 
 * momentum and trend analysis) is requiredâ€¦as always.  Weekly J Spikes carry more weight than daily J Spikes, which 
 * is more prone to alerting a false reversal.
